# Titanic Survival Prediction

This is one of my first machine learning projects where I tried to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.  
I built this while learning data cleaning, visualization, and model building in Python.

---

### Project Goal
To predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on factors like age, gender, and ticket class.

---

###  What I Did
1. Loaded and explored the dataset to understand the data.  
2. Handled missing values and converted text data into numbers.  
3. Trained a **Logistic Regression** model to make predictions.  
4. Evaluated the model using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

---

### Results & Observations
- **Model Accuracy:** around 82%  
- **Key insights:**
  - Female passengers had a much higher chance of survival.  
  - Passengers in 1st class survived more than those in 3rd.  
  - Age and Fare also influenced outcomes a bit.

###  What I Learned
This project helped me understand how to:
- Work with real data and clean it properly.  
- Visualize patterns in data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- Build a simple ML model and evaluate it step by step.  

---

###  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

###  Future Ideas
Next, I want to try:
- Random Forest and XGBoost models for comparison  
- Adding more visualization to understand feature importance better

### About Me
I’m learning AI and Data Science and working on building my portfolio one project at a time.  
This was my starting point, and I’m excited to keep improving from here!
